CMD is used to pass both executable and parameter like ["sleep","5"]

docker run ubuntu-sleeper sleep 5 // in case of CMD we need to pass both 

ENTRYPOINT point is used to define base command/executable in file and append params to it

docker run ubuntu-sleeper 10

if you are using entrypoint and don't pass any params , the call will fail... docker run ubuntu-sleeper .
In such cases combination of ENTRYPOINT and CMD both are used , to provide a default value for the command , so that command doesn't fails .
